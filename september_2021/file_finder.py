# Write a function that takes in two strings (e.g., "1.2.3.4" and "2.3.4.5") and returns a boolean as to whether or not the first string ("version") is greater than the other string ("version")

# Each string represents a version of a software or file.
# Version 1.2 is greater than 1.1
# Version 2.345.1 is greater than version 2.344.90
# Version 9.091 is less than version 9.090.1
