# Considerations

- What operating systems should the script support? (Mac, Windows, etc.?)
- How much control should the user have in running the script? (E.g., how many command-line arguments should they be able to provide, and what should each argument do?)
- How should the program accept the list of hosts? (txt file, user-input list, etc.)
- What version of Python should I consider? (subprocess.run() vs. subprocess.call(). etc.)?
