<!-- Given a list of hosts (i.e. google.com, microsoft.com, cmu.edu...), ping each host every 30 seconds.  Capture the results from each ping and after five minutes, write the results out as JSON.  The results should be grouped by host name and the groups sorted by the average rtt for the host.  You can choose to get the list of hosts from a file or accepted as a command line argument.
